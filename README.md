# Employee-tracker

Description:

This program is designed to build a employee database using mysql && the functionality of modifying the database in the terminal window using inquirer.js.
This project was completed based on the Node.js, inquirer.js and mysql database, and can be run once installed.
I have learned the ways to work at the server-side of javaScript database development, so that the front-end can retrieve the data by a set of query statements.
Built By:

JavaScript
Node.js
npm (inquirer.js)
npm (mysql2)
npm (console.table)
